<h1>An Unnecessary Addition</h1>

<p>It's not like I don't have enough websites to talk on. I mean, there's at least four websites, (Faction Fiction,
Aquarionics, Omnyom and... er... NicholasAvenell.com), Twitter (@aquarion), Tumblr (Aquarion.tumblr.com) and a number
of others. In fact, if you wanted to find me anywhere (and, indeed, everywhere) you could take a look at the <a 
href="http://hol.istic.net/walrus">Walrus</a> page that has all that stuff on it.</p>

<p>Note how that's the only one with a hyperlink? Odd that.</p>

<p>Anyway, Github give me webspace (as well as all the <a href="http://github.com/aquarion">codespace</a> I use)
so I decided to fill it with stuff.</p>

<p>I work for Istic.Networks for fun, and various other people at the same time for money. I'm currently looking for
a new job, so let me know if that's something you could help with. Who knows, maybe I'll change what's up here sometimes.</p>
